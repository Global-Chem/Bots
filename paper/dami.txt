Neural Networks possess a distinctive capability to identify relationships and detect patterns within datasets. 

# Start off with a Recurent Neural Network - 

    1.) how does it learn from languages with letters and words. 
    2.) who did it? Look at the REINVENT paper and find out who did it first with SMILES. What did they say from their abstract. 

# Lets begin now with REINVENT. 

 two interconnected networks: the Prior Network and the Agent Network # Good words

"The Prior Network is aptly named, having been initially trained to comprehend the intricate patterns and structural configurations of molecules."
Not really. Go deeper into 1 and 2.

    1.) Explain how the Prior network is a RL-policy based method. How is it initially trained?
    2.) How does a network generate the next letter in a sequence. Hint using probability?
    3.) Explain how an Agent is Trained off Chemical Input where the Policy is obtained from the prior and then goes through updates based on chemical list input. Borrow some language and 
        rearrange from REINVENT. 

# Validation

Getting there. It begins by ascertaining the validity of a generated molecule, utilizing the RDKIT module for verification, followed by an evaluation of its similarity to the chemical repository through the Tanimoto fingerprint similarity

A molecule is first validated based on whether the SMILES string is possible. (reference rdkit). 
Then the molecule is selected to be a generative descendent from the chemical list input using the Tanimoto Similarity Score metric. Models are stored in a `private-workers` repository. 

"In an endeavor to enhance this model's efficacy, a strategic decision has been made to incorporate user input into the requisite SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) list of interest."

To select how different REINVENT networks are trained we implemented commands to control the chemical input and retraining cycles occur on a weekly basis. Users have the option of adding, removing SMILES based on molecules generated by the "Mother Nature". Users can debate in an open source forum on Discord for different categories pertaining to different chemical lists. 

Use the word Intuition somewhere. 


Among these is the Reinforce Neural Network, which distinguishes itself by undergoing a process called reinforcement learning, wherein it is retrained with fresh information provided by users. In the vast expanse of chemical spaces, comprising an astonishing magnitude of up to 10^60 molecules, the potential for discovering novel compounds, distinct from those linked by Structure-Activity Relationships (SARs), becomes a distinct possibility. This Reinforce Neural Network consists of two interconnected networks: the Prior Network and the Agent Network.
The Prior Network is aptly named, having been initially trained to comprehend the intricate patterns and structural configurations of molecules. 
Subsequently, the Agent Network endeavors to generate new compounds. It begins by ascertaining the validity of a generated molecule, utilizing the RDKIT module for verification, followed by an evaluation of its similarity to the chemical repository through the Tanimoto fingerprint similarity.
In an endeavor to enhance this model's efficacy, a strategic decision has been made to incorporate user input into the requisite SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) list of interest. This augmentation serves the purpose of empowering the model by retraining it to craft novel compounds based on the infusion of novel information, thereby broadening its capacity to innovate and contribute to the discovery of novel chemical entities.
